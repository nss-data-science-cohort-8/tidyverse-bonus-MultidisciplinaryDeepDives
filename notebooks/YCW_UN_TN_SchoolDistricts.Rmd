## Tidyverse Solo Exercise

In this project, you'll practice working with data using the tidyverse libraries. 
You'll be working with data on each of 145 school districts and the State of Tennessee. This data contains, for the 2014-2015 school year:
* Proficiency rates on state tests
* Student demographics
* Chronic absenteeism
* Discipline (suspension, expulsion) rates
* High school graduation, dropout rates
* Average ACT composite scores
* A region in Tennessee  

Create an R notebook to answer the following questions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(corrr)
```




1. Read in `districts.csv` into a tibble named `districts`.

```{r}

districts <- read_csv("../data/districts.csv")
districts 

```


2. Notice that the first row corresponds to the whole State of Tennessee. Remove this row and save the result back to `districts`.

```{r}
districts <- districts |> 
      filter(!row_number() %in% c(1))
  
districts  
```


Alternative solution from Instructor Michael:


```{r}

districts_alt <- districts |> 
  filter(system_name != 'State of Tennessee')

districts_alt

```



3. How many districts have a proficiency rate of at least 80% for both alg_1 and eng_1?

13


```{r}

DistrictsCount_80percent_Alg1_Eng1 <- districts |> 
  filter(alg_1 >= 80 & eng_1 >= 80) |> 
  count(system_name)  
                      
DistrictsCount_80percent_Alg1_Eng1

```


Alternative solution:


```{r}

districts |> 
  summarize(sum(alg_1 >= 80 & eng_1 >= 80, na.rm=TRUE))

```


4. How many districts have a proficiency rate less than 50% for either alg_1 or eng_1?

8

```{r}

DistrictsCount_less50percent_Alg1_Eng1 <- districts |> 
  filter(alg_1 < 50 | eng_1 < 50) |> 
  count(system_name)  # count()
                      
DistrictsCount_less50percent_Alg1_Eng1

```

Alternative solution:

```{r}

districts |> 
  summarize(sum(alg_1 < 50 | eng_1 < 50, na.rm = TRUE))

```



5. Which district has the lowest graduation rate?

Tenn School for Blind

```{r}

districts_low_grad_rate <- districts |> 
        arrange(grad)  
        
districts_low_grad_rate

```
Alternative Solution:

```{r}

districts |> 
  top_n(-1, grad)

```



6. Within the Mid Cumberland region, which district has the highest ACT composite?

Williamson County School District


```{r}

Highest_ACT_Composite_inMidCumberland <- districts |> 
    filter(region == 'Mid Cumberland') |> 
    arrange(desc(act_composite)) 

Highest_ACT_Composite_inMidCumberland


```


Alternative Solution: 

```{r}

districts |> 
  filter(region == 'Mid Cumberland') |> 
  top_n(1, act_composite)

```


7. Create a scatter plot to compare alg_1 proficiency rates to alg_2 rates. What do you notice? Facet this plot by region. Does anything stand out when you facet the plots?

```{r}
 
ggplot(districts, aes(x = alg_1, y = alg_2, color = region)) +
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~region)

```


Alternative solution:

```{r}

districts |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=alg_1, y=alg_2)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~region)

```


8. When creating this bar chart you may have noticed that some districts have missing enrollment values. For how many districts is this the case?

4

```{r}

sum(is.na(districts$enrollment))

```

Alternative solution:

```{r}

districts |> 
  summarize(sum(is.na(enrollment)))

```




9. A lot of rows are missing additional values. Which district has the largest number of missing values (across all variables)? Hint: you might want to look at rowwise and c_across to answer this question.

West Tenn School for Deaf


```{r}
MissingValuesCount_Rowwise <- districts |> 
  rowwise() |> 
  mutate(n_NAs = sum(is.na(across(everything())))) |> 
  arrange(desc(n_NAs)) 

MissingValuesCount_Rowwise

```
Alternative solution (Variation 1), from Instructor Michael:

```{r}

districts |> 
  mutate_all(as.character) |>  # a necessary preparatory step for transmute() 
  rowwise() |> 
  transmute(total_missing = sum(is.na(c_across(everything())))) |>
  bind_cols(districts |> select(system_name)) |>
  arrange(desc(total_missing))

```
Alternative solution (Variation 2), from Instructor Michael:

```{r}

districts |> 
  mutate_all(as.character) |>  # a necessary preparatory step for transmute() 
  rowwise() |> 
  transmute(system_name, total_missing = sum(is.na(c_across(everything())))) |>
  # bind_cols(districts |> select(system_name)) |>
  arrange(desc(total_missing))

```

Alternative solution (Variation 3), from Instructor Michael:

```{r}

districts |> 
  mutate_all(as.character) |>  # a necessary preparatory step for transmute() 
  rowwise() |> 
  transmute(total_missing = sum(is.na(c_across(everything())))) |>
  bind_cols(districts |> select(system_name)) |>
  ungroup() |>  # opposite of group_by()
  arrange(desc(total_missing))

```



Alternative solutions, from Billy Brothers: 

```{r}

districts_arranged_by_NumOfMissing <- districts |> 
  rowwise() |> 
  mutate(count_na = sum(is.na(cur_data()))) |> 
  arrange(desc(count_na))

districts_arranged_by_NumOfMissing

```



Alternative solution, from Calvin Jacobson:

```{r}
districts |> 
  rowwise() |> 
  mutate(na_count = sum(is.na(c_across(where(is.numeric))))) |> 
  arrange(desc(na_count)) |> 
  head(2)
```
Alternative solution, from Nitin Pawar:

```{r}

districts |> 
  mutate(
     missing_count = rowSums(is.na(across(everything()))))  |> 
  arrange(desc(missing_count)) |> 
  head(1) |> 
  select(`system_name`)

```


10. What is the mean graduation rate across all districts? What might be wrong with using just the regular mean to assess average graduation rates?

90.06562%. Unweighted mean may give more weight to districts with fewer students. Inflating the weight of smaller districts. 


```{r}

mean(districts$grad, na.rm=TRUE)

```

Alternate solution:

```{r}

districts |> 
  summarize(mean(grad, na.rm=TRUE))

```



11. Redo the previous question but use a weighted average (`weighted.mean`) graduation across all districts, weighing by enrollment. How much does this change your answer? Can you explain using the data the reason for the big change from using the mean?
 

```{r}

districts |> 
  drop_na(grad, enrollment) |> 
  summarize(weighted.mean(grad, enrollment))

```


12. Find the unweighted and weighted average graduation rate by region

```{r}

districts |> 
  drop_na(grad, enrollment) |> 
  group_by(region) |> 
  summarize(
            unweighted_mean = mean(grad),
            weighted_mean = weighted.mean(grad, enrollment)
            )

```
